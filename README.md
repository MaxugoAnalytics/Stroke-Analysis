##Stroke Prediction Data Analysis Project

This project explores a stroke dataset to analyze the factors that may influence the occurrence of strokes in individuals. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and the development of a predictive model to classify whether an individual is at risk of having a stroke based on various health-related features.

Project Overview
This project uses data analytics and machine learning techniques to identify potential risk factors for stroke and to build a predictive model to determine stroke risk. The analysis provides insights into significant features and visualizes patterns within the data. The primary goals include:

Data Cleaning - Handle missing values, detect outliers, and preprocess data.
Exploratory Data Analysis - Explore the relationships between different features.
Feature Engineering - Select and engineer relevant features for analysis.
Model Building - Develop machine learning models to predict stroke risk.
Results Interpretation - Interpret the results and identify key features influencing stroke risk.
Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

id: Unique identifier
gender: Gender of the patient
age: Age of the patient
hypertension: Whether the patient has hypertension (1 = yes, 0 = no)
heart_disease: Whether the patient has a heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)
ever_married: Marital status of the patient
work_type: Type of work the patient does
Residence_type: Rural or urban residence
avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in blood
bmi: Body mass index of the patient
smoking_status: Smoking habits
stroke: Target variable, whether the patient had a stroke (1 = yes, 0 = no)
The dataset can be found here on Kaggle.

Results and Insights
The analysis identifies key features that impact stroke risk, including:

Age
Average glucose level
BMI
Hypertension and heart disease history
The predictive model developed achieves a high level of accuracy, with a focus on balancing precision and recall to better handle the class imbalance of stroke cases in the dataset.
